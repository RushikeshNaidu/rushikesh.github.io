			  <br>
			  <p align = "justify">The extensive increase of fraud clicks and rise of fake IPs connection have caused a lot of wastage of 
			  money and companies are currently looking for ways to minimize this problem. In order to do this several 
			  companies use several different processes. TalkingData is the largest independent big data platform for 
			  mobile devices. Due to this increase in fraud clicks and IPs, the companies paying for ads are severely 
			  facing loss of money. To prevent this, the current technique employed by TalkingData extensively revolves around
			  tracking the clicks by users which do not result in a downloaded application and eventually blacklisting these
			  channel, IPs and devices. In this project, we propose an algorithm that dynamically predict whether a click would 
			  result into a downloaded application or would it redirect to a fraudulent site.</p>

              <p align ="justify">The project has employed two techniques to understand the data and predict the fake clicks. 
			  The first method is the scalable deep learning method where the dataset is divided into partitions 
			  in order to remove the class imbalance in the principal dataset and with these datasets we apply deep
			  learning algorithm on all the datasets. The dataset is divided in a way that the majority class is 
			  divided into partitions of the size of minority class. Applying deep learning feed forward network 
			  (with binary cross entropy as loss function) on each of these result in definitions for each point. 
			  We then apply ensemble technique to define the class which the point in consideration belongs to. 
			  The second method is using several machine learning models and constantly optimizing the algorithms
			  to obtain the best possible accuracy. The final goal of the project is to merge these techniques to
			  find a compromise between accuracy and computation efficiency in terms of time and memory.</p>

			  <br>
			  <p align = "justify">Fake news has quickly become a major concern for individuals as well as organizations. With the growth of social network technology, it has dived into all sectors of the media and can cause serious harm to the person intended at. Thus we need to stop and detect this flow of news. There have been several sites trying to detect these types of news but largely it is based on their source tracking rather than understanding the semantics of the article. The project aims at predicting if a news is fake based on keywords and mentions</p> 
			  <p align = "justify">On a team of 5, crawled news articles out of Snopes.com and formulated machine learning and deep learning models in python to detect fake news efficiently.</p>
              <p align = "justify">The ground truth for the project was obtained from Kaggle. You can find the link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/arminehn/rumor-citation/data#">here.</a></p>

The Departmetn of labor has released significant data related to case status and data about every application for specific fields like Employee Address, Start Date, End Date etc. Our motivation behind this project was to predict if an application would be granted the H1B visa given a particular set of attribute values.</p> 
			  <p align = "justify">You can find the dataset <a href ="https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm">here.</a></p>
			  
              <p align = "justify">Initially the data had several missing values, insignificant attributes and several types of H1B visas. We removed the missing values, performed feature engineering to bring the individual categorical terms down and performed exploratory analysis to understand trends in the data.</p>
		
			  <p align = "justify">Since it was a classification problem we performed logistic regression, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, KNN, Random Forests and XG boost to test our models on the test data. The split of datawas 70% training and 30% test data.</p>
			
			  <p align = "justify">The result showed that XG boost had the maximum accuracy followed by random forests and KNN and logistic regression performed very poorly.</p>

			  <br>
			  <p align = "justify">Water scarcity is a major concern in rural areas devoid of water from rain. With this concern wastage of water could be fatal for some farmers living under miserable circumstances. The traditional method of providing water to crops is by the farmers through their expertise of understanding. However it can cause loss of water or also affect the yield. The project aims at automating the irrigation system through GSM and IoT in order to maintain the exact water level required for crops.</p>
			  
			  <p align = "justify">The first part of this project deals with automating the system. We inserted sensors into the ground which calculated the water level, temperature and humidity. Using this information we set a threshold on our microprocessor attached to the sensors for the lower limit and upper limit of the required level. Whenever the threshold was breached, the farmer would get a GSM message on their device regarding this breach. The farmer can handle the pump through the same device. Once the farmer sends a reply to the processor, it turns the pump on. </p> 
			 
			  <p align = "justify">Water is provided to the crops until the upper threshold is reached. Once it is reached , the pump automatically turns off. However, this process is still semi-automated because the farmer has the control to the pump. In order to completely automate the system, we set up a wifi module with the processor and harvested live data from soil.</p>
			  
			  <p align = "justify">The data was harvested to our server on MATLAB analytics graphically displayed the trends in each property. Through analyzing this trends for close to one month, we could customize our project for rice crop requirements in summer. We got great success with our results and it showed that it could be used for any crop in any seasons astronomically increasing the scalability of the project.

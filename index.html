			  <br>
               <p>We developed a business intelligence model for tatnuck bookstore which is the largest bookstore in new england. Using tableau, we aim to build two dashboards to monitor performance metrics ranging from marketing to inventory management.</p>
			   <br>
			   <p>The first proposed dashboard would be focused on marketing strategies to increase revenues and profits of the bookstore. The performance metrics considered from the data retrieved from Tatnuck anf information from Kaggle would be Sales, Profit, Inventory, Stock Rate and Customer Loyalty.</p>
			   <br>
			   <p>The bookstore is also a cafe and a gift shop which are considered in the second dashboard through employee efficiency, feedback, traffic analysis and revenue.</p>

			  <br>
			  <p>Fake news has quickly become a major concern for individuals as well as organizations. With the growth of social network technology, it has dived into all sectors of the media and can cause serious harm to the person intended at. Thus we need to stop and detect this flow of news. There have been several sites trying to detect these types of news but largely it is based on their source tracking rather than understanding the semantics of the article. The project aims at predicting if a news is fake based on keywords and mentions</p> 
			  <p>On a team of 5, crawled news articles out of Snopes.com and formulated machine learning and deep learning models in python to detect fake news efficiently.</p>
               <p>The ground truth for the project was obtained from Kaggle. You can find the link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/arminehn/rumor-citation/data#">here.</a></p>
			   <br>
			   <p>We applied logistic regression several machine learning model and a deep learning model on our data and obtained a 97% accuracy. </p>

			  <br>
			  <p>The H1B case status evaluation is a random process according to the US department of labor. The Departmetn of labor has released significant data related to case status and data about every application for specific fields like Employee Address, Start Date, End Date etc. Our motivation behind this project was to predict if an application would be granted the H1B visa given a particular set of attribute values.</p> 
			  <p>You can find the dataset <a href ="https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm">here.</a></p>
			  <br
              <p>Initially the data had several missing values, insignificant attributes and several types of H1B visas. We removed the missing values, performed feature engineering to bring the individual categorical terms down and performed exploratory analysis to understand trends in the data.</p>
			  <br> 
			  <p>Since it was a classification problem we performed logistic regression, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, KNN, Random Forests and XG boost to test our models on the test data. The split of datawas 70% training and 30% test data.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>The result showed that XG boost had the maximum accuracy followed by random forests and KNN and logistic regression performed very poorly.</p>

			  <br>
			  <p>The restaurant system is divided into three parts which are dynamically connected to each other. Each section has a relation with other. The three sections are customers, cashier and manager.</p>
			  <p>Wok this way is an online restaurant management system which allows the customers to order as per their choice in an efficient setting and an easier way. The menu is subdivided in courses, cuisines and food or beverages. This allows the customer to easily browse through what type of food they wish to order.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p> The customer is also given recommendations based on their previous orders along with the top dishes of the week at the restaurant.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>The cashier has a dynamic view of the entire table sitting in the restaurant. They can view the empty tables, occupied tables and the orders at each tables. They can manage all the billing and other documentations. The view is also provided for the kitchen so the chefs know the orders at hand.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>Once the cashier approves the bill, the data directly goes to the manager. The manager has an interactive view of all the sales in the restaurant. They can also add and remove employees as well as dishes.</p>

			  <br>
			  <p>Water scarcity is a major concern in rural areas devoid of water from rain. With this concern wastage of water could be fatal for some farmers living under miserable circumstances. The traditional method of providing water to crops is by the farmers through their expertise of understanding. However it can cause loss of water or also affect the yield. The project aims at automating the irrigation system through GSM and IoT in order to maintain the exact water level required for crops.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>The first part of this project deals with automating the system. We inserted sensors into the ground which calculated the water level, temperature and humidity. Using this information we set a threshold on our microprocessor attached to the sensors for the lower limit and upper limit of the required level. Whenever the threshold was breached, the farmer would get a GSM message on their device regarding this breach. The farmer can handle the pump through the same device. Once the farmer sends a reply to the processor, it turns the pump on. </p> 
			  <br>
			  <p>Water is provided to the crops until the upper threshold is reached. Once it is reached , the pump automatically turns off. However, this process is still semi-automated because the farmer has the control to the pump. In order to completely automate the system, we set up a wifi module with the processor and harvested live data from soil.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>The data was harvested to our server on MATLAB analytics graphically displayed the trends in each property. Through analyzing this trends for close to one month, we could customize our project for rice crop requirements in summer. We got great success with our results and it showed that it could be used for any crop in any seasons astronomically increasing the scalability of the project.
